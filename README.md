# Abstract

**Background**: While pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia
(HHT) have distinct clinical features, pathogenic variants in GDF2, encoding the BMP-9 ligand for BMPR-
II/ALK1, have been linked to rare cases of both conditions. The role of BMP-9 in the pulmonary
microvasculature, however, remains largely unexplored.
**Objective**:To assess the impact of BMP-9 deficiency on pulmonary vascular growth and remodeling in
vivo and to evaluate whether ALK1 expression alters BMP-9 transcriptional signatures in human
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMECs).
**Methods**: Gdf2 KO rats were generated via CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, followed by microfil-perfused
Micro-CT scans to visualize the pulmonary arterial tree. BMP-9 responses in human PMECs were
assessed using single-cell RNA-seq. Functional studies involved BMP-9, ML347, ALK1 siRNA, ALK1-
Fc, and two severe PH animal models.
**Results**: Micro-CT angiography revealed structural and functional remodeling in the pulmonary vascular
tree of Gdf2 KO rats, resulting in vasodilation and increased vascular density. scRNA-seq identified
distinct transcriptional signatures in human PMECs in response to BMP-9. ALK1 expression directly
impacted proangiogenic capacities and transcriptional responses of PMECs to BMP-9. Functional studies
confirmed that BMP-9 and ALK1 abundance modulated PMEC tube formation, migration, proliferation,
and VEGF/VEGFR activities. Remodeling in Gdf2 KO rats coincided with lower susceptibility to severe
PH induced by monocrotaline (MCT) and SU5416+hypoxia (SuHx).
**Conclusion**: BMP-9 and ALK1 are key regulators of pulmonary vascular growth and remodeling,
intricately interacting with VEGF signaling. Characteristics in Gdf2 KO rats suggest a shift towards an
HHT-like phenotype rather than a PAH phenotype, potentially offering protection against increased
pulmonary vascular resistance in experimental PH models.
