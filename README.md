# Abstract

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) are two distinct vascular diseases linked to impaired signaling through bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor complexes in endothelial cells. Although BMP-9 plays a central role in activating this pathway by binding to ALK1 and BMPR-­II, its
precise function in the pulmonary microvasculature has remained unclear. In this study, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for BMP-9 in regulating pulmonary vascular
architecture and homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that BMP-9 signaling intersects with VEGF pathways and contributes to the delicate balance between vascular growth
and remodeling in the lungs. We also show that disruption of this pathway can shift vascular responses toward an HHT-like state, potentially altering disease susceptibility.
These insights offer a unique perspective on how BMP-­9 and ALK1 shape pulmonary vascular biology and suggest that targeting this axis could inform future strategies for
treating complex vascular diseases such as PAH.
